# Worked example 2: Size selection in male pipefish

# Many thanks to Kenyon Mobley and colleagues for providing the dataset for this worked example
# (see main text for references)

# Before running any code, import the data file Pipefish-Data.csv from the Supporting Information
# (uncomment next line and change path as necessary)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "setwd(getwd())")

# Change code below to analyse data from populations at any of the six sites.
# Possible site values are (see main text): "VA"  "NC"  "TB"  "SJ"  "TX1" "TX3"

PipefishSiteData <- PipefishData[which(PipefishData$Site=="VA"),]

# Variance-standardise trait values and relativise (i.e. mean-standardise) mating and reproductive success
# within the chosen population

# Define our path model in the syntax of the lavaan package. Note that * is the syntax for naming path
# coefficients (i.e. it does not represent an iteraction term). This model is based on a single trait
# (body length), but if multiple traits are included, then their covariances must also be modelled
# (see worked example 'Cheating vs Caring' in Supporting Information).

pipefish.model <- 'Z~~varZ*Z    # assign name varZ to the variance in Z
M ~ bMZ*Z                       # model for mating success
R ~ bRM*M + bRZ*Z               # model for reproductive success
xZ := varZ*bMZ*bRM              # sexual selection
rZ := varZ*bRZ                  # remaining selection
sZ := varZ*bMZ*bRM + varZ*bRZ'  # total selection

# Fit the path model using the lavaan package. For consistency with equations (5) and (6) in the main text,
# we use estimator="GLS", which is equivalent to ordinary least  squares in this case. By default, lavaan
# uses maximum likelihood estimation. Many alternative estimation techniques are supported, including
# robust variants (see tutorial at http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/).
